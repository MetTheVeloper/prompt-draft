## Verification workflow

```text
inspect changed services
-> focused tests
-> smallest required service rebuild(s)
-> founder-local/runtime verification
-> explicit founder acceptance
```

Service rule:

```text
frontend only -> pnpm frontend
backend only  -> pnpm api
both changed  -> pnpm api + pnpm frontend
pnpm stack only when genuinely required
```

## Accepted runtime/staging baseline

```text
Nuxt SSR by default for acquisition surfaces
explicit client-only application route policy
Nuxt/Nitro node-server Docker runtime
independent backend API retained
server-internal API origin separated from browser API origin
Cloudflare staging: grassic.ir + api.grassic.ir
NUXT_PUBLIC_NOINDEX=true on staging
prompt-draft.ir remains untouched
```

## Accepted locale/indexing contract

```text
EN/default -> unprefixed
FA         -> /fa
self canonical per authoritative locale
reciprocal hreflang only for authoritative locales
x-default -> EN/default when EN exists
no fake localized fallback pages
staging global noindex always wins
```

## Accepted public/protected boundaries

```text
Public Prompt  -> /prompt/:id, /fa/prompt/:id
Protected Prompt detail -> /prompts?id=<id>, /fa/prompts?id=<id>
Public Creator -> /creator/:username, /fa/creator/:username
Public Blog    -> /blog, /blog/:slug, /fa/blog, /fa/blog/:slug
```

Public surfaces never expose protected Prompt bodies/variants, private Drafts, email, internal UUID/source ids, balances, permissions, sessions, storage credentials or admin data.

Creator policy remains:

```text
accessible = active account + approved Creator + canonical username
indexable = accessible + complete Creator profile
discoverable = indexable
```

## Accepted Phase 4D

```text
pnpm test:phase4d-final    PASS
pnpm smoke:phase4d-final   PASS
pnpm verify:phase4d-static PASS
```

Historical pre-Blog sitemap/llms count was 220; this is evidence only, not a permanent constant.

---

# Phase 4E Blog V1 — DONE / ACCEPTED

Editorial architecture:

```text
Git repository          -> canonical editorial source
Nuxt/Nitro deployed app -> normal public runtime source
Arvan Object Storage    -> Blog media + explicit optional mirror/emergency role
```

Never query GitHub per public Blog request.

Accepted slices:

```text
4E.1 Article Contract + Repository Loader -> DONE / ACCEPTED
4E.2 Public Blog SSR + SEO                 -> DONE / ACCEPTED
4E.3 Blog Inventory / Sitemap / llms       -> DONE / ACCEPTED
4E.4 Blog Management Authoring             -> DONE / FOUNDER VERIFIED / ACCEPTED
4E.5 Blog Media + Git Publication          -> DONE / FOUNDER RUNTIME VERIFIED / ACCEPTED
4E.6 Final Aggregate Acceptance            -> DONE / FOUNDER VERIFIED / ACCEPTED
4E.7 Shared Article Presentation           -> DONE / FOUNDER UI VERIFIED / ACCEPTED
```

Accepted aggregate evidence:

```text
pnpm test:phase4e-final    -> PASS
pnpm smoke:phase4e-final   -> PASS
pnpm verify:phase4e-static -> PASS
```

Final 4E.7 acceptance additionally verified the shared `BlogArticlePresentation` across Manage/public surfaces, hierarchical collapsible sections, theme-native prose/code/quote/list/link styling, citation badges, one-boundary section dividers, global image lightbox, RTL/LTR behavior and the one-H1 contract where the localized Article title owns H1 and body Markdown H1 is rejected outside code fences.

# Phase 4F Integration / Legacy Retirement — IN PROGRESS

4F.1 evidence closure is complete. The accepted 4A–4E contracts remain the source of truth; `/prompts?id=...`, `/user`, the `/dashboard` compatibility redirect, the shared public inventory/runtime delivery stack, Blog Nitro repository loader, static-generation compatibility path, application noindex policy and staging noindex layers remain KEEP.

First evidence-backed retirement batch:

```text
95b7d7717544d8f8c8b2fb717342cecf2432b12c
  -> removed legacy Discovery generated-HTML cleanup from scripts/generate-public-seo.ts

d44e3cb1bb257f4b8d2faa34393275c54385b47c
  -> inverted Discovery regression expectations so legacy cleanup/markers must remain absent
```

Retired behavior:

```text
LEGACY_DISCOVERY_SNAPSHOT_PATTERN
LEGACY_DISCOVERY_STRUCTURED_PATTERN
readGeneratedHtml()
cleanupLegacyDiscoveryArtifacts()
legacy Discovery cleanup calls/logging
```

The native Discovery SSR/prerender implementation remains authoritative. `scripts/generate-public-seo.ts` remains active for sitemap/llms/robots static compatibility and still consumes the shared public URL inventory.

Verification state:

```text
isolated current public-seo-generator contract assertions -> PASS 2/2
branch diff/source verification                            -> PASS
service rebuild                                            -> NOT REQUIRED
founder-local pnpm test:discovery-seo                      -> PENDING
current full static verification                           -> PENDING
```

Important 4F integration finding: `scripts/phase4d-static-generate-verification.mjs` still computes the pre-Blog expected URL count and therefore does not model the accepted 4E Blog inventory. Do not treat that historical verifier as the current standalone integration gate until it is explicitly updated or retired with evidence. `scripts/blog-static-generate-verification.ts` / `pnpm verify:phase4e-static` use the current shared Blog-aware inventory and remain the accepted post-4E static baseline.

## Hard rules

```text
DO NOT weaken authorization for SEO/Blog.
DO NOT make protected Archive detail public.
DO NOT expose protected Prompt/private Draft/private account data.
DO NOT query GitHub per public Blog request.
DO NOT make Git + Arvan uncontrolled equal content sources.
DO NOT embed base64 images in Markdown.
DO NOT make editor state canonical.
DO NOT create fake localized Blog routes.
DO NOT put draft/unpublished Blog URLs into sitemap/llms.
DO NOT recreate Blog indexability outside Article contract.
DO NOT let Blog SEO override staging noindex.
DO NOT expose BLOG_GITHUB_TOKEN publicly.
DO NOT allow canonical Blog body Markdown H1 outside fenced code; Article title owns H1.
DO NOT touch prompt-draft.ir before explicit rollout.
```

## Resume instruction

```text
1. read STATUS.md
2. read DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md + UI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md
3. read MILESTONE_21_5_PHASE4_SEO_PUBLIC_CONTENT.md
4. read MILESTONE_21_5_PHASE4E_BLOG_V1.md + 4E.7 acceptance record
5. inspect latest feature/growth-foundation HEAD
6. confirm 4E.1-4E.7 are DONE / ACCEPTED
7. current task = Phase 4F Integration / Verification / Legacy Retirement
8. 4F.1 audit is complete; first legacy Discovery cleanup retirement is implemented
9. run the focused Discovery regression, then the current Blog-aware static integration gate without rebuilding services
10. investigate the now-pre-Blog Phase 4D static verifier before updating or retiring it
11. preserve accepted public/indexability/security contracts while retiring only proven redundancy
12. do not touch prompt-draft.ir before explicit rollout
```
